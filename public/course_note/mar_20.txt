FSM written in a special scripting language
	typically the script, i.e. program written in this language is interpreted, i.e. translated at execution time line by line, as the game is running
	the best known scripting language is called Lua
	script can be checked for consistency and completenese
		e.g. make sure some next state is defined for every possibility

FSM looks like a script, but is translated by a preprocessing step into an efficient programming language

Stack-Based FSM

Multiple FSM
	keep track of different aspects of characteristics behavior via different FSMs
	levels act mostly independently
		the state at level 0 is updated according to the FSM at level 0, 
		the state at level 1 is updated according to the FSM at level 1, 
		the state at level 2 is updated according to the FSM at level 2, etc. 

Hierarchical FSM
	break overall FSM into lower-level FSMs (like modules)
		high level FSM + serval low level FSMs
		can repeat for more levels
	adv: high level FSM can guide loading and unloading of low level FSMs
		low level FSMs can be reused in multiple high level FSMs

Steering behaviors
	Craig Regnolds
	
	Seek
		given a position P and a target T, a current velocity V, and a maximum speed Max_V, find the steering velocity
	flee
		opposite of seek
	pursuit
		seek + knowing where the target is going
	evade
		flee + knowing where the target is going
	offset pursuit
		pursue an offset position to the target knowing where it is going
	arrival
		a distance to decide wether to slow down
	wonder
		draw a circle in front, pick one point on the circle randomly, and use it as direction frame by frame
