Collision detection for 2 spheres
	assume no acceleration => constant velocity

Dot product
v_1 = [x_1,y_1,z_1]
v_2 = [x_2,y_2,z_2]
v_1 [dot] v_2 = x_1*x_2 + y_1*y_2 + z_1*z_2

We want the earliest time in collision 

when collision happens, the distance is equal to the sume of the radius

Thus 

sqrt( v_1 [dot] v_2 ) == r1 + r2
